          What is a Galaxy?<br />
                                        We live on a planet called Earth that is
          part of our solar system. But where is our solar system? It’s a small
          part of the Milky Way Galaxy.A galaxy is a huge collection of gas,
          dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held
          together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supemassive
          black hole in the middle.

        What is a Planet?<br />                             A planet must do
        three things: it must orbit a star, it must be big enough to have enough
        gravity to force a spherical shape, and it must be big enough that its
        gravity cleared away any objects of a similar size near its orbit.<br />
                                    <br />The planets in our solar system didn’t
        appear out of nowhere. Neither did the sun. They were all part of a big
        cloud of gas and dust. Gravity collected lots of material in the center
        to create the sun. The left over stuff swirled around the forming sun,
        colliding and collecting together. Some would have enough gravity to
        attract even more gas and dust, eventually forming planets.<br />                             Scientists
        spent a lot of time arguing over what a planet actually is. In 2006,
        they came up with a definition. They said a planet must do three things.
        The first thing might seem obvious—it has to orbit around the sun.
        Second, it must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a
        spherical shape . And third, it must be big enough that its gravity
        cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around
        the Sun.

        What is the Big Bang?<br />                                     The big
        bang is how astronomers explain the way the universe began. It is the
        idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and
        stretched to grow as large as it is right now—and it is still
        stretching!<br />                                     In 1927, an
        astronomer named <strong>Georges Lemaître</strong> had a big idea. He
        said that a very long time ago, the universe started as just a
        <strong>single point</strong>. He said the universe
        <strong>stretched</strong> and <strong>expanded</strong> to get as big
        as it is now, and that it could keep on stretching.<br />                                     Just
        two years later, an astronomer named
        <strong>Edwin Hubble</strong> noticed that other galaxies were moving
        away from us. And that’s not all. The <strong>farthest</strong> galaxies
        were moving <strong>faster</strong> than the ones close to us.

        sizes="100vw"
        alt=""
      />
      <div>
        This meant that the universe was <strong>still expanding</strong>, just
        like <strong>Lemaître</strong> thought. If things were moving apart, it
        meant that long ago, everything had been close together.

        Yeah.I know a lot of you want to know what is dark matter.<br />                            Dark
        matter is stuff in space that has gravity, but it is unlike anything
        scientists have ever seen before. Together, dark matter and dark energy
        make up 95% of the universe. That only leaves a small 5% for all the
        matter and energy we know and understand.<br />                           This
        might be a surprise, but we don’t know what <em>most</em> of the
        universe is made of. Seriously, we don’t. You might be thinking, “But of
        course we do! It’s made of galaxies, stars, planets, black holes,
        comets, asteroids, and all the other cool space stuff!”Yes, there is a
        lot of amazing space stuff, but if we add it all up, it’s just a very
        small part of the entire universe. There’s a lot more out there. And we
        don’t fully understand what it is.<br />‍
